## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Cannlytics is a healthy mix of user friendly interfaces and software that you can use in your cannabis-testing lab. Users do not have to have any advanced knowledge and can jump in at any point. There are many advanced features that people with background in the web stack, Python, or your favorite programming language can jump right into. The Cannlytics Website provides people with information about Cannlytics. The Cannlytics Engine is a mobile, desktop, and web app that provides administrators, laboratory staff, laboratory clients, and client integrators to interact with laboratory information.

The Cannlytics App began with [Flutter Folio](https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter-folio) as a template, overhauling the state, potentially routing, and dependency management framework to utilize [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get).

You can run your app locally for development, adding tags as needed depending on your desired platform.

```sh
flutter run
```
